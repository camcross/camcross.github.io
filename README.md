## Cam's personal page
#### June 18, 2014

## Overview

#### Motivation

- This is a simple profile, designed to showcase basic information 
about myself
- This profile is designed for fun, not for professional purposes
- The target audience for this page includes friends, family, and iX peers

#### Content

- A brief "about me" paragraph containing a few sentences to introduce myself
- Description of my education: Past achievements, current goals, and aspirations for the future
- List of hobbies, supplemented with photos
	-> Here, can include soccer photos, running photos, salsa videos, etc.
- Pictures of me relevant to each section of information
- Contact information

## Design

- The design of this page will take a very middle-of-the-road approach; it will not be minimalistic, but it will also not be cluttered with designs and sharp colors
- Simple designs and photos will decorate each page; clear and sharp headers and lines will divide each section

#### Code

This page will be constructed using HTML and CSS, and possible a little JavaScript. The profile will have several linked pages, all accessible via a toolbar of sorts in the header to direct ot each section (About Me, Contact Me, etc.)
The page will use HTML header, body, and footer. There will also be a sidebar with a link to my Facebook page.
Within each page, there will be logical divisions; these divisions will usually separate photos and videos from the text itself. This text will describe the aspect of myself that the page advertises; the media will illustrate my descriptions.
