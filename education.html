			<p id="p1">
				<strong>As a 20-year old college kid, I barely know enough about myself to fill an About Me page at all, but I'll give it a go. I'm a 3rd-year UVa student from Southern VA, looking to double major in Commerce and Economics. What I will do with these degrees is still a total mystery, so I'm doing as much traveling and self-exploration as I can in the hopes of finding my path.</strong>

				<strong><span id="goals">My Goals</span><br>Between soccer trips in Brazil, foreign exchange in Argentina, coding in South Africa and beyond, I've had some memorable adventures. Each time I allow myself to leave my comfort zone in pursuit of something foreign, I realize that my goal in life is to keep pushing my limits until I find what it is that makes me truly happy. This is easier said than done, but I'm excited for what lies ahead.</strong>

				<strong>When I'm not traveling or studying, you'll find me outside running, playing soccer, reading, playing piano, salsa dancing, or spending time with family. I have a lot of hobbies-- read more about my interests in the Hobbies section of my site!</strong>
